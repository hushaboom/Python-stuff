Conky clone...
This is just a lightweight system monitor which displays cpu, memory, and hdd usage info.  Work in progress.
Works on Ubuntu Mate 22.10

To use, make monAssis.py executable with: 
chmod +x monAssis.py 
and run it from terminal:
./monAssis.py & disown
or drag the file icon to your mate-panel and just click on it!
